I built this comprehensive React application to stay ahead of the curve in the crypto world. Real-time data, insightful news, and in-depth analysis.

## 🔑 Key Features:

- 🚚 **Live Market Data**: Track current prices, charts, and historical trends for hundreds of cryptocurrencies through API (Coinranking Rapid API).
- 🧠 **Smart News**: You can read and filter the news base on your prefrence of coin (Connexun News Rapid API).
- 📉 **Interactive Charts and Analysis**: Can visually see price changes with interactive charts (Chart.js JS Library).
- 🧐 **Cryptocurrency Details**: more detailed info about coins including their exchanges, history, and key metrics.
- 📲 **User-Friendly and Responsive Design**: Responsive and user-friendly interface built with ANTD UI.
- 🧑‍💼 **Data Management**: Used (Redux-Toolkit + RTK Query) for efficient state management and API calls, for smooth and responsive user experience.
- 🔐 **Secure API Key Handling**: For protecting my API keys through an .env file, prioritizing security and privacy.

## ✍️ Process

🤠 My API playground: Eager to get my hands dirty with APIs and Redux Toolkit, I decided to build a crypto app as my testbed. First, I scoured RapidAPI for free data sources and crafted a clean layout, complete with slick routing and a trusty Redux store. The homepage served as a launchpad, offering glimpses into the Cryptocurrencies and News pages.

😵 Next, I tackled the Cryptocurrencies page, showcasing 100 digital coins in all their glory. But I didn't stop there! The Cryptodetails page unveiled each coin's hidden depths, including mesmerizing historical price charts powered by Chart.js (thanks Javascript Mastery). News was another beast, and I built a dynamic feed with a handy filter, letting you zero in on the latest buzz around specific coins. Finally, the Exchange page rounded things off, displaying exchange options and stats for every crypto – a one-stop shop for all your trading needs.

😀 This project was a wild ride, but every API hurdle and Redux puzzle I conquered made it worth it. And now, my very own crypto app stands as a testament to the power of curiosity, code, and a little inspiration from Youtube tutorials!
